# Typeroo
A monkeytype-inspired typing/spelling trainer that focuses more on accuracy than on speed.

# How to play
Just put main.py in any interpreter, even an online one. It is also reccomended you add a txt file on your computer with the list of words you'd like to train on. You can load this onto Typeroo instead of manually writing it.

# Dependancies
- tkinter (Already comes with Python on Mac and Windows, but on linux run: sudo apt-get install python3-tk)
- Python (3.10.5 used, but any future version should work)

More coming soon, as right now we're lacking features.
