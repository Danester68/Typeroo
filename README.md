# Typeroo
A monkeytype-inspired typing/spelling trainer that focuses more on accuracy than on speed.

# How to play
Just put main.py in any interpreter, even an online one. Pygame is a dependancy (just type pip install pygame into your terminal), but it is not needed in this version so feel free to delete the line if you don't want Pygame. And, of course, it's written in Python which can be installed via the website and online interpreters already have it.

More coming soon, as right now there's barely anything.
